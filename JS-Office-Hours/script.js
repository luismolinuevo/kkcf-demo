//Variables
//Var and let could changed later in the code
//Const cannot be changed later on in the code
//A variable stores data. Think of x = 5 in math. A neamed container of data.

let name = "Luis";
var age = 22;
const birth_day = "10/10/2001";
let price = 0.5;

//Data types

//Its a string because its between double quotes.Strings are useful for holding data that can be represented in text form. Some of the most-used operations on strings are to check their length, to build and concatenate them using the + and += string operators, checking for the existence or location of substrings with the indexOf() method, or extracting substrings with the substring() method.
let string_ex = "Luis";

//Int. Like a integar in math. A number thats not a decimal
let int_ex = 1;

//Float. A decimal
let float_ex = 0.5;

//Boolean. True or false
let boolean_ex = false;
let boolean_ex_2 = true;

//Loging data(console.log)
console.log("Hello world");

//How to check what datatype of value is(typeof varname)
console.log(typeof boolean_ex);
